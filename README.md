# CLI Python Tutor 

## Description

This command line interface-based application leverages the OpenAI API to generate answers to python related questions. It also explores principles of prompt engineerng through the use of LangChain output parsers. 

I loved getting exposure to using OpenAI's API and learning about principles of prompt engineering. I have personally found this useful as I am advancing my python skills. I hope you do too! In the future I hope to make this into a full stack application.


## Installation 

Run `npm install` in the command line to install packages. 

Initialize the application by running `node script.js`.
